    body: '## Reasoning:


      Built to replace manual YAML editing for portfolio project pages. The tool integrates work reports (stored in PostgreSQL)
      with portfolio projects (stored as YAML files). The modular architecture replaced the legacy 6-file JS layout using
      observer pattern to break circular dependencies. Event delegation eliminates memory leaks. Connection pooling prevents
      database exhaustion. Archive feature keeps reports panel uncluttered. Import feature provides one-click project creation
      from reports.'
