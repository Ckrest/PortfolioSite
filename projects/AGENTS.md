# Projects Data Guidelines

- `settings.yaml` inside each `projects/<slug>/` folder is the canonical metadata source.
- `projects/manifest.json` is generated by `projects/_build.js`; do not edit it directly.
- Required `settings.yaml` fields are enforced by build and schema:
  - `title`
  - `summary`
  - `date` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Keep folder names and slugs stable and meaningful. Avoid numeric suffix slugs (`-2`, `-3`) unless truly intentional.
- Keep block `content` valid for `projects/detail.js` renderers; unknown block types fail build.
- Store project-local assets in the same project folder (usually `icon.svg`, `preview.svg`, `media/*`).
- If schema fields or enums change, update `projects/_project-schema.yaml` and regenerate the manifest.
