      <h1>Analytics Onboarding Sprint</h1>
      <p>
        A rapid prototype cycle focused on helping enterprise analysts adopt a new insights platform. We validated guidance
        patterns, experimented with progressive disclosure, and shipped high-fidelity flows in under two weeks.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The team mapped the first-week journey for new analysts, identifying friction around data permissions and orientation. We
        introduced guided tasks, inline glossary support, and a personalized summary page populated with live metrics.
      </p>
      <p>
        By testing interactive Figma prototypes with five analysts, we confirmed that contextual prompts reduced setup time by
        35% and improved confidence scores during usability sessions.
