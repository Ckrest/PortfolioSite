  - body: '## Description:


      Moved trait data from manifests to separate trait_<name>.yaml files. Enhanced trait definitions with schema, resolve,
      output, aggregations, queries sections. Added trait-api-schema.yaml, trait-template.yaml, and registry/handlers/. New
      traits: forked-from, path-dependencies, published, standalone-git, untracked. Deleted: git-submodules, mcp-tools, own-git-repo,
      upstream. 174 files changed across 50+ packages.'

  - body: '## Reasoning:


      Previous system embedded trait data in manifests requiring hardcoded transforms. New design follows declarative-over-imperative:
      traits define their own schema and API behavior, packages provide data in separate files, API serves dynamically without
      code changes.'
